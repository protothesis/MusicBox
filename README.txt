The Metro has a small disk drive so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing
which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index 
or .Trashes files!

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing main.py in your favorite text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes
with a built in REPL serial viewer! It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest 
code. Try enabling the single-button keyboard!
         (HINT: look for the "# optional! uncomment below..." text)

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, 
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). 
On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 
On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
